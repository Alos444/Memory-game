## Project Overview
This project is a single-player memory card game where the objective is to match pairs of cards based on their images. The game challenges the playerâ€™s memory by requiring them to remember the positions of the cards to find and match all pairs.

The game consists of two main pages:

### Entry Page.
A page where the player enters their name to start the game.
### Game Page
The main game page where the player interacts with the card game.

## Technologies and Techniques

HTML: Structure of the pages including the form for name entry and the game board.
CSS: Styling for the pages and game elements to ensure a user-friendly interface.
JAVASCRIPT: Game logic and functionality for handling user interactions, card flipping, matching, and determining the game outcome.

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Add animations for card flipping and matching.
Include sound effects for better engagement.
Additional Features:

2. Implement a timer to track how long it takes the player to complete the game.
Add a leaderboard to compare scores with other players.

3. Extend the game to support multiple players and track scores for each.

   ## HOW TO PLAY:

1. Start the Game:

2. Click on any card to flip it and reveal the landmark.
Find Matches:

3. Click on another card to find its matching pair.
If the two cards match, they will disapear.
If they don't match, they will flip back after a second.

4. Match all pairs before the timer runs out to win.
You have 3 minutes to find all matching pairs.
5. Keep an Eye on the Timer!!!
